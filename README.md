# GPT CLI

GPT CLI is a Python-based project that enables natural language command execution. With this command-line interface, you can interact with your system using plain English commands, making it easier and more intuitive to perform various tasks.

## Installation

To use GPT CLI, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sabari245/gpt-cli.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd gpt-cli
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Update the `env` file with your desired settings and configurations. This file contains environment variables that can be customized to suit your needs.

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and updated the `env` file, you can start using GPT CLI. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The CLI will start, and you can enter natural language commands to execute various actions. For example, you could say "create a file `example.txt`," or "combined tasks like commit and push to the origin" and GPT CLI will perform the corresponding action.

Feel free to explore the available commands and experiment with different tasks using natural language.
